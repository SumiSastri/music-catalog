Full stack app with the MERN (mongoDb-Express-React-Node) stack

## SCAFFOLDING
- mkdir inventory-app
- npm init (set-up your own webpack) OR
- npm init
- npm install mongoose express
- npm install -D nodemon (as a dev dependency - not needed for production version)
- npm install cors path dotenv concurrently

## SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
In the src files create frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) folders to separate concerns Folder naming convention - camel case

## BACKEND FOLDER STRUCTURE
- The server.js file is for the Express server
- Database (db)
- Data Schemas & Data Design Constructors (models)
- Controllers for CRUD routes (routes)
- Configuration (config)

## FRONTEND FOLDER STRUCTURE
- create a front-end folder
- npx create-react-app client
- this creates the client side node modules, git-igore package-lock-json src and public files/folders
- in the client-side package-json files add your proxy local host under the eject scripts
- in the server-side package-json files add scripts to run the client and server side

```
"scripts": {
		"client-install": "npm install --prefix client",
		"start-server": "nodemon server/server.js",
		"start-client": "npm start --prefix client"
```        
- npm install bootstrap react strap uuid react-transition-group

## VERSION CONTROL
Set up github repo and link local version

- git add .
- git commit -m'initial commit'
- git remote add origin - ssh key
- git push -u origin master
- Check out of master and create branches [git checkout -b branch-name]
- Check out of branch to master and merge branch to master

### Branch 1 server-set-up (Express server)
Go to package json and set up nodemon to and start-server script "start-server": "nodemon <server relative path>"
Code server and npm run start-server check connection

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
const cors = require('cors');

require('dotenv/config');

app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

app.listen(3000, () => console.log(`app server connected on port ${port}`));
push changes to the branch origin
git push --set-upstream origin server-set-up
check out of branch [git checkout master]
merge branch to master [git merger server-set-up]
push to origin master and set up new branch
Branch 2 mongodb-set-up (cloud-based mongoDB)
Login to mongoDB/ Create a db cluster [inventory-app]
Connect
whitelist IP address
create user name
auto-generate a password
choose a connection method - local db or cloud-based db
Get a connection string or URI - ``` mongodb+srv://user-name:@cluster0-ox7di.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority]
set up ORM mongoose to connect Express server to mongoDb cloud
Manually test the db is connected

```
       mongoose.connect(
   'mongodb+srv://user-name:<auto-generated-password-pasted-here>@cluster0-ox7di.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority',
   {
   	useNewUrlParser: true,
   	useCreateIndex: true,
   	useUnifiedTopology: true
   },
   (error) => {
   	if (!error) {
   		console.log('mongo-db connection working');
   	} else {
   		console.log('check mongo-db connection');
   	}
   }
);
mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;
```

Check that files are not included
To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked, use git rm --cached
set up .env files and ensure they are in gitignore files [ https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files] / [https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore]
username:password - remove <> which are placeholders
```
        require('dotenv/config');

        mongoose.connect(
	'process.env.DB_CONNECTION',
	{
		useNewUrlParser: true,
		useCreateIndex: true,
		useUnifiedTopology: true
	},
	() => {
		console.log('connected to mongoDb');
	}
);
```
### Branch 3 crud-routes (set-up routes and check with Postman)
Plan your data schema and set it up with a constructor - new mongoose.Schema export the module schema for the server-side controllers or routes you will set up for the CRUD actions (create-read-update-delete).

First create the routes in server.js and test them

```
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
	res.send('app home route working');
});

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
	res.send('music-inventory-api route working');
});
Then move the get route its own folder
Create a routes folder with an express router object
Now instead of app.get()/ you use router.get()
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
	res.send('music-inventory-api route working');
});
```
import the libraries you need in your routes folder and the data schema in a variable
now code your CRUD routes and check they work in Postman and that the data persists in the mongodb database
to test your routes you also need to modify the server.js file
although Express now has body-parser baked in, I found that I need to add body-parser to get the body to be converted into JSON
the placement of the middleware is important to use the server-side routes you have set up
the server should now look like this with body-parser imported and the route file path imported.
```
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

const musicInventoryRoute = require('./routes/inventoryRoute.js');

app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

app.use('/music-inventory-api', musicInventoryRoute);

app.use(
	bodyParser.urlencoded({
		extended: true
	})
);
```
