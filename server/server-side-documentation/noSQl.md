### Not Structured Query Language - NoSQL
A database, meaning a structured way to store and access data.

**What is a Structured Query Language?**

SQL dbs are used when data is stored in a structured format. Object classes, which represent the items that will go into those structured tables, must also be designed. It can be considered like an automatic car where a lot of design work is pre-built. This can be costly, but on the pro-side easier to use.

PostGres is a RDBMS (relational database) that uses SQL (structured query language as a programming language). PostGres skills are transferable to SQL and MySQL.

PostGres can be used with Node and Express with JavaScript libraries in the front-end. ORM's like Sequelize can be used but you can also work directly with the DB.

**What is NoSQL?** 
- Not Structured Query Language - NoSQL (MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis and Apache Cassandra.)

NoSQL, on the other hand, is the absence of that structure. It is more like a manual car where data is put into collections without paying much attention to the structure. As a result, there's less up-front design work - you configure the db more to your own needs than to a pre-fab structure. Again there are pros and cons to both data models. Instead of tables, joins and connections NoSQL dbs are stored in documents and collections.

NoSQL is a very generic term used to describe any data store that doesn't use legacy approach of related tables of data. This means that you're storing your data in an organized way, but not in rows and columns An example of NoSQL databases can be anything from a library card catalog, to a more sophisticated data store like MongoDB.

Since the range of what NoSQL means is so wide, we must narrow our definition further. MongoDB is a NoSQL document database. This means that data in MongoDB is stored as documents. These documents are in turn stored in a collections of documents.
