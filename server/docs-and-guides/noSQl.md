### Not Structured Query Language - NoSQL

**What is a Structured Query Language?**

SQL dbs are used when data is stored in a structured format. Object classes, which represent the items that will go into those structured tables, must also be designed. It can be considered like an automatic car where a lot of design work is pre-built. This can be costly, but on the pro-side easier to use.

**What is NoSQL?** 

NoSQL, on the other hand, is the absence of that structure. It is more like a manual car where data is put into collections without paying much attention to the structure. As a result, there's less up-front design work - you configure the db more to your own needs than to a pre-fab structure. Again there are pros and cons to both data models. Instead of tables, joins and connections NoSQL dbs are stored in documents and collections.
