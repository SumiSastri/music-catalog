A MongoDB database is one big object containing collections. Each collection has contextual items, for example, contacts for a database. Then inside a collection we have documents which are the contacts themselves.
User contact information would be in several indivdual documents. Inside each document we have the data for each contact, such as address, telephone, email, et cetera.

The document, itself, looks like a JSON object with a key-value pair approach or arrays of data. Mongoose, middleware, allows us to set a schema for a collection and pre-define what each key-value pair takes as type.


### Branch 1 mongodb-set-up (cloud-based mongoDB)
- Login to mongoDB/ Create a db cluster [inventory-app]
- Connect
- whitelist IP address
- create user name
- auto-generate a password
- choose a connection method - local db or cloud-based db
- Get a connection string or URI - ``` mongodb+srv://user-name:<password>@cluster0-ox7di.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority]```
- set up ORM mongoose to connect Express server to mongoDb cloud
- Manually test the db is connected

```
       mongoose.connect(
   'mongodb+srv://user-name:<auto-generated-password-pasted-here>@cluster0-ox7di.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority',
   {
   	useNewUrlParser: true,
   	useCreateIndex: true,
   	useUnifiedTopology: true
   },
   (error) => {
   	if (!error) {
   		console.log('mongo-db connection working');
   	} else {
   		console.log('check mongo-db connection');
   	}
   }
);
mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;
```

- Check that files are not included
- To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked, use git rm --cached
set up .env files and ensure they are in gitignore files [ https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files] / [https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore]
username:password - remove ```<>``` which are placeholders

```
        require('dotenv/config');

        mongoose.connect(
	'process.env.DB_CONNECTION',
	{
		useNewUrlParser: true,
		useCreateIndex: true,
		useUnifiedTopology: true
	},
	() => {
		console.log('connected to mongoDb');
	}
);
```
